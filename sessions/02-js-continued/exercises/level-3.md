    },
    hr: {

    }
  }
};

// Employee structure
const employeeExample = {
  id: "EMP001",
  name: "Amit Kumar",
  department: "engineering",
  baseSalary: 50000,
  allowances: {
    hra: 15000,    // House Rent Allowance
    ta: 5000,      // Travel Allowance
    da: 10000      // Dearness Allowance
  },
  deductions: {
    pf: 6000,      // Provident Fund
